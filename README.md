## Overview

For this challenge, I was asked to create a static blog preview card showcasing some content, a call to action with emphasis on hover and focus states.

## The task

I was provided some design images of both desktop and mobile, no Figma file this time, but I did have a style-guide.md file to work with so that I didn’t have to estimate fonts and colours etc.

## Approach

I approached this task with more confidence since I knew to keep it simple and use a Flex layout with a `flex-direction: column;`.

Again, I wrote down every HTML element I could see and some initial styles like `background-color`.

:gear: CSS Flex  
:gear: Desktop-first workflow

## Lessons

1. `focus` vs. `focus-visible:` The difference is still unclear to me, but I will keep an eye out to pay attention to this in future because it had implications on this solution that I’d like to understand
2. Ordering elements in a stack visually: I wanted to use the `order` property by making a flex container but this seemed to complicate the problem… Instead I reordered in the HTML, which I didn’t want to do... What’s the best way to address this?
3. My focus states only work in Safari… not Chrome. I had fun making them, though

## Take forward

:grey_exclamation: I can really loyally pull off a design with CSS. What else can CSS do? Excited to get into animations etc…  
:grey_exclamation: Pay attention to focus states in the future… I hadn’t really considered these before.  
:grey_exclamation: I can work a lot faster than I thought. HTML + CSS are coming more naturally to me now…  
:grey-exclamation: Hover states are fun

## Feedback

I received positive feedback on this solution namely that it captures the original design accurately. I also discussed some challenges I had with peer-learners.

_“Great design, looks very close to the original! The code is well-written and easy to read.”_
