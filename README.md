## Overview

For this challenge, I was asked to create a static blog preview card showcasing some content, a call to action with emphasis on hover and focus states.

## The task

I was provided some design images of both desktop and mobile, no Figma file this time, but I did have a style-guide.md file to work with so that I didn’t have to estimate fonts and colours etc.

## Approach

I approached this task with more confidence since I knew to keep it simple and use a Flex layout with a `flex-direction: column;`.

Again, I wrote down every HTML element I could see and some initial styles like `background-color`.

## Built with

:gear: Semantic HTML5 markup  
:gear: CSS Flex  
:gear: Desktop-first workflow

## Lessons

1. I designed with Grid instead of Flex due to not understanding layouts well yet
2. I wrote up media queries when I didn’t need to
3. Accessibility Law requires that every page must have a h1 on it somewhere. What do we do when there isn’t an obvious one?

## Take forward

:grey_exclamation: Do the simplest thing. Don’t overdo things and give yourself unnecessary, time-consuming work.  
:grey_exclamation: Your design-eye comes in handy here… You notice things that others don’t.

## Feedback

I got positive and really helpful feedback on this project which I integrated on reflection after sharing. This included how to center content in Flexbox and style font-sizes with relative units. See below:
